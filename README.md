Code for exact learning.

The projects contains 2 classes found in code/circuits
- Oracle implementing the uniform quantum example oracle
- TNN implementing the tunable quantum neural network

The quantum amplitude amplification procedure can be found in code/circuits/qaa.py

The algorithm for exact learning can be found in code/exact/exact.py

The update strategy for k-juntas and another class of concept can be found in code/update_strat/updates

get_results.py trains the network over the class of concepts and for a given number of runs.
